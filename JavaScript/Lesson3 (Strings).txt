// Strings

1> String is a text.

2> //concatenation -> means combine strings together
   e.g:- 'some' + 'text' = 'sometext'

3> //to check datatype of anything
   e.g:- typeof  ....;

4> //type coercion -> means automatic type conversion
   e.g:- 'hello' + 3 = 'hello3'  // here 3 is a number but it is converted to string, and then added to hello.

5> JavaScript adds from left to right.

6> String also follows order of operations, means we can use brackets () to control which part of a Calculation
   gets done first.

   eg:- a) '$' + 20.95 + 7.99  = '$20.957.99'
        b) '$' + (20.95 + 7.99) = '$28.93999999'

7> // 3 ways to write String
   (i)   '....'   ->  use this by default
   (ii)  "...."   ->  use this whenever we have to use a single quote inside a string
   (iii) `....`   ->  strings created with backtick have a name and are called template strings (Template Strings)

8> Template Strings have some special features:-
   (i)Interpolation -> insert value directly into a string.
   e.g:- `Items ${}`;
   ${} -> this set of characters allows us to insert value directly into string.

   (ii)Multi-line String ->
   e.g:- `some
         text`;

9> Interpolation is a much cleaner way of inserting a value into a string.
   -> So, use Interpolation in place of concatenation.

10> What should we use to crate a string???
=>  (i)  Use '....' by default.
    (ii) If we need Interpolation and Multi-line strings, then use ----> `....` (Template Strings)

11> (i)   \'   --> creates a single quote that is just text.
    (ii)  \"   --> creates a double quote that is just text.
    (iii) \n   --> newline character, adds a newline.


***** In this lesson we learned *****
1) String = text
2) Use strings and numbers together
3) Three ways to create strings:
   '....'     "...."    `....`(template strings)
4) Escape characters: \'   \"    \n
5) Interpolation & Multi-line Strings
