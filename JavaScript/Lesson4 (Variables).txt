// Variables

1> What is a Variable??
=> A variable is like a container, we can save a value like a number or a string inside a variable
   and then use it later.

2> console.log();  //it is used to display the output in the console of web browser

3> let result = 2;
=> here, result is variable  & 2 is value

4> In JavaScript, we can save any TYPE of value inside a variable like Numbers, Strings etc.

5> Variable name Restrictions:
=> (i)   Can't use special words.
   e.g:- let 
   (ii)  Can't start with a number.
   (iii) Can't use special characters, except:- $ _

6> ;  //semicolon means the end of a instruction.

7> JavaScript is little special,
           -> because it has a feature called Semicolon Insertion, that means it will try to insert the 
           last semicolon in a line of code automatically.

           -> But don't do it. Insert the semicolon manually.

8> onclick = " ";  // this attribute will run some JavaScript when we click the button.

9> Variable Re-assignment Shortcuts:-
   += 2     variable = variable + 2;
   -= 2     variable = variable - 2;
   *= 2     variable = variable * 2;
   /= 2     variable = variable / 2;
   ++       variable = variable + 1;
   --       variable = variable - 1;

10> Naming Conventions:-
=>  (i)   camelCase          e.g:- cartQuantity
    -> we use camelCase everywhere in JavaScript

    (ii)  PascalCase         e.g:- CartQuantity
    -> we use this in JavaScript in only one place (later in course)

    (iii) kebab-case         e.g:- cart-quantity 
    -> it doesn't work in JavaScript
    -> however, we use this in HTML and CSS

    (iv)  snake_case         e.g:- cart_quantity
    -> used in other languages

11> 3 ways to create variables in JavaScript
=>  (i)   let variable1 = 4;
    -> we can change it's value later

    (ii)  const variable2 = 3;
    -> use this by default
    -> can't change it's value later

    (iii) var variable3 = 3;
    -> we don't use var nowadays due to some security issues.

12> Best Practice -> use const by default
    (only use let when we need to change the variable)
